You can use explainshell asresource if you want to understand what the commands below are doing: https://explainshell.com/

HIGH PRIORITY: 

Update the box: 
> sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y == update and upgrade the box (ubuntu)

Change the root password: 
> passwd == change current users password

If there are other nessessary users on the box update those passwords as well: 
> sudo passwd <USERNAME> == change specific users password

Establish a baseline for new files that have been added to the box. 
1. Run the following command: ls -la /etc/ssh/
2. In the list of files that is retunred look for "ssh_host_<SOME-VALUE-HERE>" and "ssh_host_<SOME-VALUE-HERE>.pub"
3. Make note of the dates associated with these files and investigate any files that have been added since this date. 
4. You can use the following commands as a reference to find files added after a specific date: 
- find / -newermt "2021-02-12" ! -newermt "2021-02-19" -ls 
- find / -newermt "2021-02-12" ! -newermt "2021-02-19" -ls 2>/dev/null | grep -v ' /etc\| /var\|.....'

Look for ssh keys: 
> cd ~/.ssh
If there are keys present remove them, and regenerate if nessessary. 

General Investigation:

USERS: 

> w == show who is logged on and what they are doing

> sudo -l/etc/sudoers == check users that have permission to sudo

> less /etc/passwd == check users listed in the passwd file

> less /etc/shadow == check users in the shadow file (file contains password information)


Check with your team prior to removing users. You can then delete users with the following command: 
> sudo deluser <USERNAME-HERE> == remove a user from the system

GROUPS:
> groups == print the groups a user is in

EDGE CASE: if user is part of the docker group this could lead to privesc or be abused by red cell. 
Notify a member of the team if this is discovered. 


Check with your team prior to removing groups from the box. You can delete groups with the following command: 
sudo delgroup <GROUP-NAME-HERE> == remove a group from the system

NETWORK:

> netstat -a | more == print out all network connections on listening and non-listening sockets

> netstat -nap == view listening ports

> lsof -i == list of processes listening on ports (ref p72 Blue Team Field Manual)

> lsof -nPi | cut -f 1 -d " " | uniq | tail -n +2 == list open files using the network (ref p73 Blue Team Field Manual).

> netstat -nputw

> cat /etc/hosts: Looking for suspicious domains in hosts file for example 127.0.0.1 totallynotahacker.org (ref p37 Blue Team Field Manual)

> sudo iptables --list == list current IPTABLES rules on the box (ref p35 Blue Team Field Manual)

PROCESSES and SERVICES: 

> ps aux == show snapshot of current processes

> ps -aef --forest == report a snapshot of the current processes

> pstree == display a tree of processes

> service --status-all == list all services + is running - is not running

> eval $(process name here) == this will return the process id (PID) of a specific process 

CRONJOBS:
> crontab -u <USERNAME>-l == list crontab entries by user

> crontab -l == list crontab entries

Look in the /tmp and /opt directories for suspicious files. 

UFW FIREWALL: 

<WIP>
ufw reference ATTN: If enabled check rules on a regular basis to verify there are not being used to block services we are maintaining.

enable ufw
configure the firewall for the necessary ports and services on the box
once configuration is complete review with member of the team
add configuration information to <out team sheet?>
enable ?????
<WIP>
