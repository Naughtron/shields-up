### SSH BASICS ### 

A bashic ssh connection using a password would be: 
$ssh <username>@<ipaddress>
***prompt for password here*** 

Passing ssh keys and not using passwords is more secure. 
$ ssh -i <name of key file> <server-username>@<ipaddress>

When it comes to administration of servers the first time you log in you will be prompted asking if you 
want to connected. Say yes to this. 

When you say yes to this prompt the ip address you are contacting is added to a list of known hosts

### GENERATE SSH KEY PAIRS ### 

TO generate a set of keys use t he following command: 
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
-t == type
ed25519 == a more secure key type than the default

Following the command there will be the following prompts: 
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_ed25519): == this is the default storage location for the keys
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): == you can add a password here to make it more secure

There will now be a public/private keypair in the .ssh dir

The .pub is the public key. This is the key you can share or send to other servers. 
The other is the private key and this should NEVER be shared. 


### HOW TO PASS KEYS TO SERVERS ###
$ ssh-copy-id -i <name of keyfile> <server-username>@<ip of server>
-i == include file

Verify that the public key is in place on the remote server's .ssh directory and look in the authorized_keys file

### HOW TO USE KEYS TO CONNECT TO SERVERS ### 

Now you can connect to the server by just using 
$ ssh <server-username>@<servier-ip>                                                                                                                                                      255 тип
Enter passphrase for key '/home/kali/.ssh/id_ed25519': <passphrase to the key here>
